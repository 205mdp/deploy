
<h2>E:2.14	KIDNAP/EXTORTION</h2> 

<p>In the extraordinary event of a kidnapping of an associate (or a guest) the Division Crisis Representative or one of the Corporate Contact representatives must be notified immediately per the Crisis Response & Communications Plan.  Starwood Hotels & Resorts has a specific policy regarding how kidnappings or extortions must be handled and who is to be involved.  That policy is considered too confidential to put into this document.</p>
