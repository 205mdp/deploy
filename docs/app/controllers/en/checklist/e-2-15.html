<h2>E:2.15	LABOR ACTION/STRIKE</h2>

<p>Labor actions taken by groups not directly representing Hotel associates are considered “secondary” labor actions or strikes and actions allowed vary widely by local law and custom.  In the event of a secondary action, the General Manager should contact Division Representative to the Corporate Crisis Response Team to advise of the issue and then provide appropriate advice to associates.  If associates have questions, they should contact the Hotel General Manager or director of HR.</p>

<p>If an action occurs without warning or without sufficient time to consult HR and Legal, the basic guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Protect guests</li>
	<li>Protect property</li>
	<li>Communicate with local authorities</li>
	<li>Document any damage</li>
	<li>Communicate up the chain of command</li>
</ul>
