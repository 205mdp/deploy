<h2>E:2.2	CIVIL DISTURBANCE</h2> 
<p>A civil disturbance is the action of a group of people demonstrating or protesting for an issue or cause.  The disturbance can occur in or near the hotel; it may be related to a guest or group using the facilities.  A civil disturbance can be peaceful – or violent (see below).  In any event, the immediate concern is always the protection of hotel guests, associates and property.</p>


<p>Any associate noticing a civil disturbance should immediately contact Security.  The Security Office will then be used as an initial Command Post.  A fully equipped Command Post may later be needed.</p>

<p>Unless a disturbance turns violent and presents an immediate danger to guests and associates, DO NOT attempt to forcibly disperse protestors.  That activity should be left to law enforcement authorities.</p>

<p>It is also important that associates not engage protestors in debate or shouting matches.  Media may be present and confrontation will only tend to escalate news coverage.  In other words, don’t create a media event.
