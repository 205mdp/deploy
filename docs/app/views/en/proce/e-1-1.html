<h2>E:1.1	ASSISTING DISABLED GUESTS</h2>

<p>Many emergencies will require special assistance for guests with disabilities.  The most obvious are emergencies which require evacuation, search and rescue or shelter-in-place.</p>

<p>Each Hotel must develop a plan for identifying and providing assistance to guests with special needs in the event of any emergency or crisis.</p>

<p>The procedures should include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Method of identifying guests with special needs</li>
	<li>Location of list of disabled guests â€“ front desk is recommended</li>
	<li>Frequency of list updates</li>
	<li>Responsibility for maintaining list</li>
	<li>Procedures for assuring disabled guests are attended during any emergency</li>
</ul>
