<h2>E:1.2	DECONTAMINATION</h2>
<p>
Exposure to chemical agents (such as harsh cleaning chemicals) can cause a variety of reactions, including blurred vision, eye irritation, difficulty breathing, nausea â€“ and worse.  As a result, a person affected by a chemical or biological agent requires immediate medical attention by professional medical personnel.  DO NOT ignore or minimize symptoms, or wait for them to improve.
</p>
<p>
Decontamination is needed within minutes of exposure to minimize health consequences.  The extent of the need should be evaluated, first aid treatment of any victims should begin and the appropriate agency should be contacted.  In the event of a serious exposure to chemicals, call emergency response authorities.  
</p>
<p>
There are two broad, primary goals in a decontamination procedure:  First, remove the contaminating material from the victim and the areas where it exists, and second, keep it from spreading to other victims and areas.  In the U.S. treat according to MSDS.
</p>
<p>
If decontamination is required, the procedures below should be followed.  The General Manager or Director of Security should supervise all work.  The fastest alternative for decontamination may be jumping into the Hotel pool, although the pool may become temporarily unusable as a result.
</p>
<p>
Contact should be made immediately with Divisional Representative to Corporate Crisis Team.
</p>
<p>
TREATING CONTAMINATED VICTIM</p>
<ul>
	<li>Manufacturers Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) should be consulted for decontamination requirements.</li>
	<li>Use extreme caution when helping others who have been exposed to chemical agents.</li>
	<li>Put on, as appropriate, protective clothing, overshoes, gloves, etc. from the decontamination kit.</li>
	<li>Remove contaminated clothing from the victim and other contaminated items in contact with the body.</li>
	<li>Contaminated clothing normally removed over the head (for example, t-shirts), should be cut off to avoid contact with the eyes, nose and mouth.  Put the clothes into a plastic bag, seal and dispose per local and national regulations.</li>
	<li>Decontaminate hands using soap and water.  Use a soft nailbrush for cleaning under fingernails, using care not to break the skin.</li>
	<li>Remove eyeglasses.  Put glasses in a pan of household bleach to decontaminate.</li>
	<li>Flush eyes with lots of water.</li>
	<li>Gently wash face and hair with soap and water, then thoroughly rinse with water.</li>
	<li>Decontaminate other body areas likely to have been contaminated.  Blot, (do not swab or scrape), affected areas with a cloth soaked in soapy water and rinse with clear water.  If the contaminated areas of the body are extensive, put the victim in a shower.</li>
	<li>Provide the victim with uncontaminated clothes.</li>   
	<li>Proceed to a medical facility for screening.</li>
</ul>

<p>TREATING CONTAMINATED AREAS</p>
<ul>
	<li>Manufacturers Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) should be consulted for decontamination requirements.</li>
	<li>Cordon off the contaminated area with rope or barriers.</li>
	<li>Contact the local hazardous materials vendor identified in the Preparation Section.</li>
	<li>Shut down HVAC system and any fans in area to avoid spreading fumes.</li>
	<li>Close any doors into area and seal edges with tape.</li>
</ul>
