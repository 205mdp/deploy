<h2>E:1.3 EVACUATION</h2>
<p>
The primary factor in determining whether or not a hotel evacuation will be successful is planning.  In other words, hotels should have evacuation plans ready and in place – including primary and secondary assembly areas – for all guests and associates.  There is no time to develop plans once an emergency has begun; evacuation plans must be created beforehand and all associates should be familiar with them as part of their job duties.</p>
<p>
Designated assembly areas could include the lobby, the parking lot, the pool area, etc. – perhaps even a building or area next door to the hotel.  Whatever location is chosen should be easily accessible and capable of holding a large group of people.</p>
<p>
Signs should be prepared to designate assembly points and/or evacuation routes.  They should be of adequate size to be seen from across a lobby area, for instance.  The signage should be kept behind the front desk area to be readily accessible to be put in place immediately.</p>
</p><p>
Perhaps the most important rule in any evacuation is to never use the elevators; use fire stairwells instead.  Evacuation routes should be checked daily by security to ensure that they are free of any hazards and are well lit.
</p><p>
It is also critical that associates stay calm at all times.  Guests will look for guidance and leadership from associates during an emergency.  Without associates providing a steady hand, panic may develop, which greatly increases the likelihood of injury – or worse.
</p><p>
Finally, in the event of a complete evacuation, all associates should ensure that they, in fact, do evacuate the hotel (after assisting guests).  DO NOT put yourself at risk by staying in the hotel to protect or secure things.  The preservation of life is more important than equipment or property.  </p>

<h2>GENERAL EVACUATION GUIDELINES</h2>

<p>In the event of a partial or complete evacuation of a hotel due to fire or other emergency situation, the following procedures apply:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Prepare for evacuation upon hearing the fire alarm or being given verbal instructions to evacuate.</li>
	<li>In a fire, use fire stairwells – never the elevators.  Elevators are fine in a non-fire related evacuation.</li>
	<li>Walk.  Do not run.  Stay calm.</li>
	<li>Ensure that fire doors are not blocked open.</li>
	<li>Assist guests and other associates, including those with disabilities, as needed.</li>
	<li>Proceed to the designated evacuation assembly areas.</li>
	<li>Associates should stay with their departmental colleagues once in the assembly areas so that a head count can be performed.</li>
	<li>Always place your hand on the back of a door before opening it.  If hot, do not open and find an alternate route.</li>
	<li>If you enter a smoke-filled area, seek another exit route if possible.</li>
	<li>If you must pass through an area filled with smoke, cover your nose and mouth with a towel or piece of clothing, dampened with water if possible.  Crawl low along the wall to the nearest exit.</li>
	<li>If unable to evacuate due to a blocked exit or other barrier, attempt to enter a guest room or other area free from fire and smoke.  Immediately call Security and advise them of your location.</li>
	<li>Once in the guest room, fill the bathtub with as much water as possible.  Soak towels, sheets, etc. and place them in the cracks between the door and the floor.  Turn off the heat and air conditioning.  Cover the vent.  DO NOT open the window or try to break glass unless directed by fire department personnel.</li>
	<li>Immediately report anyone stranded to Security, the Emergency Response Team, or fire/police personnel.
WORK AREA PREPARATION</li>
	<li>If an evacuation is imminent – and it is safe to attempt – the following tasks should be undertaken:</li>
	<li>All equipment should be returned to its storage areas.</li>
	<li>Cashiers should drop all monies in the General Cashier’s safe.</li>
	<li>Food and Beverage should ensure that all food and liquor storage rooms are secure.</li>
	<li>Lock down as much as possible to prevent vandalism and theft during the emergency.</li>
</ul>
