<h2>E:1.6 SHELTER-IN-PLACE</h2>
<p>
Depending upon the nature of the emergency, it may be safer to keep guests and associates inside the Hotel rather than evacuate.  Such events that require shelter-in-place include:</p>

<p>Weather emergencies</p>
<p>Chemical release outside Hotel</p>
<p>Natural Gas leak outside</p>
<p>Terrorist threats or actual release of weapons of mass destruction</p>

<p>(Modified shelter-in-place procedures may be required for such events as blackouts around the hotel or civil disturbances outside which would require guests to be protected inside the Hotel.)</p>

<h3>OPERATOR</h3>
<ul>

<ul>
	<li>Quickly close all exterior doors and windows.</li>
	<li>Post security personnel or designated associates at all Hotel exits/entrances to ensure guests and associates remain inside and that exterior doors remain closed.</li>
	<li>Select interior rooms above the ground floor with the fewest windows or vents to temporarily house guests and associates not required to assist with shelter-in-place procedures.  The room or rooms should have adequate space for everyone to be able to sit.  Avoid overcrowding as it may create discomfort and panic.</li>
	<li>Access to hard-line phone is preferred as cellular service could be overwhelmed by a widespread event.</li>

	<li>If there appears to be a danger of explosion outside, close all window shades, blinds or curtains.</li>
	<li>Seal any air vents into the selected rooms.</li>

	<li>Gather information on all guests and associates present and review status and assist any guests with special needs such as the disabled.</li>
	<li>Monitor public media and law enforcement to determine when emergency has cleared.  Do not attempt to determine by personal exploration whether threat has ended.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3>ENGINEERING</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Turn off all HVAC equipment to prevent spread of dangerous airborne agents.</li>
	<li>Using duct tape and plastic sheeting or bags, cover all accessible air inlets which draw outside air into the HVAC system.</li>
