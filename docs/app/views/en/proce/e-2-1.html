<h2>E:2.1 BOMB THREAT</h2>
<p>In most cases, the hotel operator will receive the bomb threat.  It is critical that the person receiving the threat remains calm and tries to obtain as much information as possible.  A “Bomb Threat Checklist” is provided (attached) and should be completed while talking to the caller if possible.  In particular, pay close attention to the voice characteristics of the caller and listen for any background noises on the call (e.g., office machinery, motors or engines, street noises).</p>

<p>If the caller makes demands or attempts to negotiate, inform them that only hotel management is authorized to negotiate and that they will be notified immediately.  Then, contact the General Manager and law enforcement authorities as directed to inform them of the threat.</p>

<p><strong>IF A BOMB – OR WHAT IS POSSIBLY A BOMB – IS FOUND, DO NOT OPERATE RADIOS AND CELLPHONES IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>IF A SUSPICIOUS ITEM IS DISCOVERED, DO NOT TOUCH OR MOVE IT.  THE JOB OF THE SEARCH TEAM IS ONLY TO FIND THE BOMB AND REPORT IN.  LEAVE THE REMOVAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS.</strong></p>

<h3>OPERATOR</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If a bomb threat is received, complete as much of the “Bomb Threat Checklist” as possible while the caller is still on the line (Checklist attached).</li>
	<li>Call Security with the exact threat and specifics of the call.</li>
	<li>Notify the Emergency Response Team, Security and other radio users (e.g. Managers and Engineering) via telephone.  DO NOT announce over the radio that there is a bomb threat. </li>

</ul>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>	 
<ul>
	<li>Notify the Director of Security or Security Manager.</li>
	<li>Contact law enforcement authorities with the specifics of the call.</li>
	<li>Begin a search of the property if instructed to do so by the Security Director, General Manager or MOD.  See “Common Areas to Search” and “Search Techniques” (attached).</li>
	<li>Maintain a log of associates involved, times, and all activities.</li>
	<li>Once a Command Post has been established by the Director of Security, keep the Post updated on the status of the search.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to initiate evacuation procedures if required.</li>
	
</ul>
<h3>DIRECTOR OF SECURITY OR SECURITY MANAGER</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Establish a Command Post and communications channels (land telephone lines most preferred) between the Post, search parties and local authorities.  Stay at the Command Post to direct team members and receive calls.</li>
	<li>Determine from law enforcement authorities if they will conduct the search or if Hotel is to conduct the search.</li>
	<li>If Hotel is to conduct the search, dispatch the Emergency Response Team to search the property.</li>
	<li>Dispatch searchers in teams of two if possible.  Give searchers the complete information received from the caller.  Issue search cards to each team (“Common Areas to Search” and “Search Techniques”).</li>
	<li>Ensure that each search team member has a flashlight.  (Flashlights are kept in the Security Office).</li>
	<li>Establish a deadline for discontinuing the search.</li>
	<li>Instruct search parties to immediately report any suspicious objects.  Search team members SHOULD NOT touch or move any item.  </li>
	<li>Be prepared to evacuate the hotel.  If an evacuation is necessary, an announcement should be made to guests that the hotel is “experiencing an emergency situation.”  DO NOT say that a bomb threat has been received.</li>
	<li>Cooperate with law enforcement authorities at all times.  If a device has not been found and the area is considered secure by law enforcement, issue an “All Clear” notice to hotel associates.</li>

</ul>

<h2>BOMB SEARCH</h2>

<p>Bomb threats must always be taken seriously, and if one is called in, security must determine from law enforcement authorities if law enforcement or the Hotel is to conduct a search for the device.  If the Hotel has the search responsibility, the senior most manager in the hotel at the time the threat is received should assume responsibility for organizing and conducting a search of the property.  The General Manager or the Director of Security may relieve the senior manager once they arrive on the scene.</p>

<p>Members of the bomb search group should consist of Security and Engineering, as well as all management and supervisory personnel on the premises.  The group should be divided into teams of two if possible, and each team should carry search cards to assist in their task.  (See “Common Areas to Search” and “Search Techniques” included in this section).</p>
<p>If the caller provides the specific location of the device, the search teams should begin the search in that area.  Immediately evacuate the area and close it off until the bomb has been removed, or the time of detonation has passed.</p>

<p>If the caller does not mention any specific location, the MOD, along with Security, will determine the areas and the order of the search, as well as the need for evacuation.  The actual decision to evacuate or not should be made by the General Manager or Director of Security if they are available.</p>

<p>IF A SUSPICIOUS ITEM IS DISCOVERED, DO NOT TOUCH OR MOVE IT.  THE JOB OF THE SEARCH TEAM IS ONLY TO FIND THE POTENTIAL BOMB AND REPORT IN.  LEAVE THE REMOVAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS.</p>

<h3>SEARCH TECHNIQUES</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Develop search parameters.</li>
	<li>Be alert to sounds and smells.</li>
	<li>Develop a systematic pattern of searching from right to left.</li>
	<li>Divide the area in half.  During the first visual sweep: Enter the room and go to opposite ends of the area.  Stand still and become attuned to the sounds, smells and vibrations of the area.  Look around and notice anything new or obviously out of place</li>
	<li>During the second visual sweep: Search from floor to waist height.  Search should begin at the given point and work outward, one person going to the right – the other going to the left.  Search everything from the floor to waist height.  Continue around the area until the search team meets.</li>
	<li>During a third visual sweep: Search from waist height to the ceiling.  The search team should return to the starting point and again work outward – one to the right, the other to the left.</li>
	<li>During the fourth visual sweep: Search drapes, doors, false ceilings, etc.</li>
	<li>Look for anything that looks unusual or out of place (e.g., packages, pieces of pipe, fuses, lumps of clay-type plastic, etc.).</li>
	<li>Avoid changing the environment.  If going into a dark area, do not turn on the lights.  Use a flashlight.</li>
	<li>DO NOT TOUCH any suspicious item(s).</li>

	<li>Immediately evacuate the area including the floor above and the floor below.</li>
	<li>Cordon off the area to prevent any unauthorized entry.</li>
	<li>Assist police and fire department personnel as needed.</li>
	<li>Security Director should direct other search team members to re-assemble at the Command Post.</li>
	<li>Initiate printing of the Registered Guest list.</li>
