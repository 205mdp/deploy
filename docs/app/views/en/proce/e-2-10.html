<h2>E:2.10	FOODBORNE ILLNESS/DEATH</h2>

<p>A foodborne illness outbreak is considered a possibility when two or more unrelated persons report illness from food.</p>

<p>It is important that hotel staff takes reports of suspected food illness seriously and reacts swiftly when notified of a situation involving possible contaminated food.  Certainly it is serious from a health standpoint since tainted food can cause very serious medical conditions and even death.  But it is also important from a public relations perspective.  If not handled in a timely and aggressive manner, reports of contaminated food can seriously damage the reputation – and the business – of a hotel’s dining establishments and even the hotel itself.</p>

<p>Contact the Division Representative to the Corporate Crisis Response Team and determine when to notify the health department.  Food service may need to be discontinued until the cause can be pinpointed and the health department gives the “All Clear.”</p>

<p>Should a serious outbreak of foodborne illness or a death occur due to tainted food, media interest is likely.  DO NOT attempt to respond to media inquiries.  Refer all inquiries to the General Manager or designee.</p>

<p>In general, the following steps should be taken when a guest or associate becomes ill due to suspected food illness:</p>

<h3>DIRECTOR OF FOOD & BEVERAGE OR DEPARTMENT MANAGER</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Inform the General Manager as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Immediately discontinue serving any items that may be suspected of causing the illness.</li>
	<li>Interview associates who may have prepared the food or served the guests who are ill to determine not only the foodservice details but also whether any associates were sick when they were preparing or serving the food.</li>
	<li>Ensure that hotel food service staff reacts in a low-key, professional manner so as not to alarm guests needlessly.</li>
	<li>If contacted by local health authorities, immediately notify the General Manager.</li>
	<li>Cooperate with local authorities at all times.  Do not destroy or remove items that may be important to an investigation.</li>
	<li>DO NOT comment about any previous incidents of food illness to those who are ill or to other guests.</li>
	<li>Assist the General Manager in gathering all necessary information from those who have become ill (see General Manager duties below).</li>
	<li>Maintain a copy of the “Suspected Foodborne Illness Questionnaire” (sample attached) and any other pertinent information concerning the outbreak for a period of two years.  If serving seafood, maintain tags and/or box label if box is still available.</li>

</ul>
<h3>GENERAL MANAGER </h3>
 
<ul>
	<li>Contact the person(s) who have become ill as soon as possible and attempt – at a minimum – to gather the following information requested on the attached “Suspected Foodborne Illness Questionnaire.” </li>
	<li>Be sympathetic to those who are ill; don’t minimize their condition.</li>
	<li>Assure guests that the situation is being investigated promptly.</li>
	<li>Notify the Division Representative to the Corporate Crisis Response Team with specifics of the incident.</li>
	<li>Fax copies of all information and completed forms (such as those attached) to the Corporate Office.</li>
	<li>Cooperate with local health authorities if they become involved.</li>
	<li>After the incident has been closed, follow up with guests who became ill to express concern and determine their well-being.</li>
</ul>
