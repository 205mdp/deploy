<h2>E:2.11	HAZARDOUS MATERIAL/CHEMICAL SPILL</h2>
<p>An associate discovering a chemical or hazardous material (HAZMAT) spill such as chlorine, should immediately contact Security.  The severity of the spill and the type of chemical or material involved will determine the level of response required and if evacuation is necessary.  In any case, the first responsibility is the safety of the guests and associates.</p>

<p>Move guests and other associates away from the material. If the spill is severe and the chemical is believed to be dangerous, evacuate the Hotel. </p>

<p>Local emergency services (9-1-1 in the U.S.) should be called if anyone has come in direct contact with a hazardous chemical and needs medical assistance.  If in an exposure area, move the injured/ill person to a safe area and remain with them until help arrives. Associates should not attempt to provide assistance except as directed.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental ideas that should be kept in mind when responding to a chemical or HAZMAT spill situation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Assist people first.</li>
	<li>Secure the spill area after all people have been safely evacuated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>OPERATOR</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If notified of a chemical or HAZMAT spill, contact Security immediately.  Provide the location, name of the chemical and extent of the spill, if known.</li>
	<li>Notify the Emergency Response Team and provide all information known.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Immediately respond to the scene with the Material Safety Data Sheet book (MSDS).</li>
	<li>Notify Engineering, via radio or pager, that there is a chemical or HAZMAT spill.  Give the location, name of the chemical (if known) and extent of the spill.</li>
	<li>Notify the Director of Security.</li>
	<li>If necessary, calmly inform guests of the situation through the hotel’s public address system or available communication process.  Evacuate and isolate the area around the spill.</li>
	<li>Provide first aid to affected individuals.</li>
	<li>Obtain required personal protective equipment (PPE) as outlined in the MSDS.</li>
	<li>Perform traffic and crowd control functions.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to contact local authorities, providing them with all information known.  Request that a HAZMAT unit be dispatched.</li>

	<li>Attempt to identify the chemical or HAZMAT involved.  Use caution when approaching.</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions in the MSDS.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the affected area has been evacuated and cordoned off.</li>
	<li>Establish a first-aid room if necessary.</li>

		<li>Chemical Spill Response Kit</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Obtain from Security the required personal protective equipment (PPE) as outlined in the MSDS.</li>
	<li>Follow instructions for clean up as directed in the MSDS.  Decontaminate the area.  (Note: Contaminated materials must be disposed of at a permitted hazardous waste management facility).</li>
	<li>Ventilate the affected area(s) if appropriate.</li>
