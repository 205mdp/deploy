<h2>E:2.12	HOSTAGE SITUATION</h2>

<p>Hostage incidents create a unique set of challenges.  Because lives are in immediate danger, it is likely that both the hostage and the hostage taker will be highly emotional and perhaps irrational.  As a result, it is important that all hotel associates remain calm and give the appearance of control and calmness at all times.</p>

<p>Any associate who becomes aware of a hostage situation should immediately contact Hotel Security.  DO NOT attempt on your own to rescue the hostage or overpower the hostage taker; that is best left to trained law enforcement personnel.</p>
