<h2>E:2.13 INJURY OR ILLNESS</h2>
<h2>E:2.13.1 GUEST MEDICAL EMERGENCY</h2>


<p>Handling a medical emergency will depend, in part, on whether the injured or ill person is conscious and able to make their own decisions or not.</p>

<p>First, any associate who becomes aware of a medical emergency should contact Hotel Security and remain with the injured/ill person until help arrives.  Associates should not attempt to provide assistance unless they have been trained in CPR.</p>

<p>If the individual is not conscious or able to make decisions on treatment, then local emergency services (9-1-1 in the U.S.) should be called.</p>

<p>If an individual is conscious and apparently capable of making decisions, the individual should make a choice on what service they require, where they would like to be taken and by whom they are to be treated.</p>

<p>Provide a list of several hospitals, clinics or doctors, and if warranted offer to call emergency services.</p>
