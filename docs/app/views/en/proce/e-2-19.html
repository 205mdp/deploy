<h2>E:2.19	TERRORISM OR THREATS OF TERRORISM</h2> 

<p>All Threat Countermeasures should be followed.  For terrorism and similar threat-related countermeasures, refer to the Threat Countermeasures Matrix and Guidelines located in the Threat Section of this Manual and on StarwoodOne.</p>

<p>Whatever the threat or actual event, the immediate goals in any terrorism emergency are to identify victims that require prompt medical attention and to ensure that, if possible and appropriate, all guests and associates leave the affected areas quickly, safely and without panic.</p>

<p>And, any act of terrorism impacting a Hotel would meet the criteria of a crisis and require immediate notification of the Area Managing Director/Regional Vice President, the Division Crisis Representative and Corporate, as listed in the Preparation Section.</p>
