<h2>E:2.21.2 HEATING OR AC FAILURE</h2>

<p>In the event that the heating or air conditioning system for the Hotel should fail, associates should immediately notify the General Manager, Security and Engineering. Set up an easel in the lobby area to keep guests updated on the situation. Keep windows and doors closed as much as possible to maintain a comfortable air temperature for as long as possible. If the outage lasts for a longer period of time, it may be necessary to open windows and doors to circulate air during air conditioning failure.</p>

<p>If the heating and cooling equipment is expected to be down for a longer than 24 hours (possibly less, depending upon weather conditions), be prepared to move guests to another location. Assist any guests who have special needs. Answer all guest questions and reassure them that everything is being done to quickly remedy the situation.</p>

<h3>GENERAL MANAGER</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Contact Engineering if they have not already been notified.</li>
	<li>Notify Security and obtain a list from the Front Desk of guests who may require special assistance. Instruct Security to check on these guests.</li>
	<li>Establish a Command Center where information can be gathered and disseminated on the status of equipment repairs.</li>
	<li>Obtain additional fans and space heaters from a rental equipment company, if necessary. Distribute them from the Command Center keeping careful track of where they are being used.</li>
	<li>Have additional fans and space heaters on hand to provide to special-needs guests (elderly, infant or disabled guests.) If you distribute space heaters, have Security set-up the heaters in the room and advise guests to keep the area around the heater clear. All additional fans and heaters should be used in public spaces only.</li>
	<li>Set-up a meeting or banquet room as a “Guest and Associate Comfort Area.” Put fans in the room during hot weather and space heaters in the room during cold weather. If the outage will last for more than a few hours, set-up cots, provide temperature-appropriate linens and pillows.</li>
	<li>Post updates on an easel in the lobby.</li>
	<li>Make an announcement over the Public address system or available communication process.</li>
	<li>Example: “Attention Ladies and Gentlemen. We are experiencing problems with our (heating or air conditioning system). We are currently working to restore service. Please keep windows and doors closed to preserve the current air temperature as long as possible. We invite you to visit ??? room. It has been established as our “Guest Comfort Area” where we are maintaining temperatures with (fans or heaters). We will keep you informed as we repair the system. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation.”</li>
	<li>If the heating and cooling system will not be repaired for more than 24 hours, contact other facilities and make arrangements to move guests, if necessary.</li>
	<li>During hot weather provide plenty of bottled water to guests.</li>
	<li>During cold weather provide guests with extra blankets.</li>
	<li>Direct all department heads to keep track of costs. Complete incident report and collect cost information from all departments for insurance purposes. </li>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

	<li>Report to the Command Center frequently with status updates on any guest issues.</li>

</ul>
<h3>ENGINEERING</h3>

	<li>Submit regular progress updates to the Command Center and General Manager.</li>
