<h2>E:2.21.3 POWER FAILURE</h2> 

<p>In the event of a Hotel power failure or area blackout, notify the Director of Security and Engineering, particularly if they are not on the property. 
</p>
<p>Assure guests that everything is under control. Advise them to remain where they are until the situation is resolved. All associates should work together to assist guests and create a calm atmosphere that helps to reduce the inconvenience of the situation as much as possible.</p>

<p>Do not use open flames, propane or gas as a light source because these present serious fire hazards. Shut off all gas during the power failure.</p>

<p>The Fire Command Station is the staff assembly area during a power outage or blackout. </p>

<p>Virtually all actions are the same whether the power loss is local to the Hotel or also involving the area around the Hotel, or even large portions of the city.  The primary difference is that with a prolonged local loss of power, the Hotel may be able to relocate guests if necessary.  Obviously, with a widespread blackout, that would not be practical.  In fact, in such blackouts, the Hotel may be called upon to assist people caught in an area away from their local home.</p>
