<h2>E:2.22	WEATHER EMERGENCIES</h2>
<h2>E:2.22.1 FLOOD</h2>

<p>Flooding caused by rising water from an overflow of a body of water or a severe storm may take place suddenly or with some warning.  Experience will identify Hotels most vulnerable to such rising water emergencies.  Flooding caused by broken or leaking pipes is covered in Section 2.21.6.</p>


<p>The stages of Flood alerts are as follows.  Weather services should be monitored to better prepare.</p>
<p><strong>FLOOD WATCH</strong></p>
<p>A flood watch implies that a flood is a real possibility, but is not imminent.</p>
<p> <strong>FLOOD WARNING</strong> </p>
<p>A flood warning implies that a flood is imminent or is in progress and that immediate precautions should be taken.
</p>
<p> <strong>FLASH FLOOD WARNING</strong> </p>
<p>A flash flood warning implies that a flash flood is imminent or is in progress and that immediate precautions should be taken.  A flash flood is a sudden, violent flood after a heavy rain.</p>

<p>If a flood risk is imminent, complete Pre-flood Checklist (attached to the back of this section).  If immediate action needs to be taken, evacuate guests and other associates from the low-lying areas, if possible.  Move to higher floors using the stairs, not the elevators.</p>

<p>CAUTION: If a shock hazard exists in the affected area. DO NOT ENTER until Engineering has shut off ALL power to the area.</p>
