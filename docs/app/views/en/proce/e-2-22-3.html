<h2>E:2.22.3 TORNADOES</h2>

<p>Associates should be aware that tornados typically occur quickly and without warning. Once the Weather Service has issued a Tornado Warning, emergency procedures should begin immediately.</p>

<p>Be on alert for signs of tornadic activity which include dark, discolored sky, wind changing direction to a circular pattern and the distinctive loud sound of an oncoming tornado.</p>


<p>Weather Terms:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tornado Watch- conditions are right for the formation of a tornado</li>
	<li>Tornado Alert- a tornado has been spotted</li>
	<li>Tornado Warning- a tornado is on a path moving toward the general area.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>Remain calm and reassure guests that all precautions are being taken to ensure their safety. The safest area of the Hotel is below ground level. The next safest areas are inside the stairwells or interior corridors away from windows. Under no circumstances should anyone remain in front of or near windows or exterior walls.</p>
