<h2>E:2.4	COMMUNITY/LOCAL AREA CRISES</h2>
<p>From time to time, hotel properties may be affected by events or crises in the local community that do not directly impact the hotel, but which may have an affect on its normal operations.  Examples could include a large fire in a building next door to the hotel, a flood caused by a river that has spilled over its banks or a terrorist activity in the area.</p>


<p>While it would be difficult to compile a list of every conceivable local crisis that could indirectly impact a hotel – and thus, provide detailed responses to a large number of scenarios – there are some general guidelines that can be followed in dealing with community emergency events.</p>
<p>Overall, the local hotel should try to be a good corporate citizen and assist the community in any reasonable way it can during a local crisis.  Be a “Good Samaritan.”  Rise to the occasion warranted.  Possibly use meeting rooms or common areas.  If there are questions about the risks, contact the Corporate Legal Division.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<ul>
	<li>In the event of a local crisis, establish a Crisis Command Post as a place to monitor events, and plan and direct hotel responses.</li>
	<li>Notify the Emergency Response Team and have them report to the Crisis Command Post.</li>
	<li>Closely follow developments in the crisis.  Stay in contact with local authorities directing the community response.</li>
	<li>Have all hotel associates on stand by to assist guests and protect hotel property should the community crisis result in a hotel emergency. </li>
	<li>Begin planning and preparing for an evacuation of the hotel should one be necessary.  Plans should include an escape route from the property.</li>
	<li>Assist the General Manager as needed.</li>
	<li>Prepare the appropriate reports after the crisis is over, with photographs or diagrams.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GENERAL MANAGER </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Closely monitor the situation.  Work with Security to keep apprised of all developments.</li>
	<li>Keep a written record of the crisis and all hotel activities as events unfold.</li>
	<li>Periodically inform guests and associates of the situation through the public address system or available communication process.</li>
	<li>If time permits, mingle with guests throughout the property and reassure them that the hotel stands ready to act if the crisis escalates.</li>
	<li>Ensure that an evacuation plan is in place, including transportation from the property.</li>
	<li>Ensure that all associates know their responsibilities and duties in the event of an emergency or evacuation and that they are ready to perform them.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to instruct Guest Reception to secure cash registers, folios, credit card vouchers and safe deposit boxes.</li>
	<li>Arrange for alternate accommodations for guests should the hotel need to be evacuated.</li>
	<li>Ensure that hotel staff has facilities available if they are confined to the hotel for a lengthy period.</li>
	<li>If the media seeks to use hotel property as a headquarters or staging ground for filing stories, try to politely discourage them from doing so. </li>
	<li>Refer media to local authorities for comment or information.  Do not let the hotel become the focus of stories about a community crisis.</li>
	<li>Do not at any time publicly criticize local authorities or emergency personnel for their response to the crisis.</li>
	<li>Once the crisis has passed, be sure and thank local authorities for their efforts, if appropriate. </li>
