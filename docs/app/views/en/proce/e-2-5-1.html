        </a>
<h2>E:2.5	CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h2>
<p>Associates should take care to not put themselves at risk if discovering criminal activity.  Contact Security and aid victims as described in this section and as appropriate, but do not put yourself at risk in attempting to prevent the activity or in apprehending the perpetrator.  </p>


<p>For any criminal activity, complete the Description Form in E2.5.5.</p>

<h2>E:2.5.1	ASSAULT, PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL</h2>

<p>Any associate who witnesses a physical or sexual assault in progress, discovers an assault victim, or who are themselves the victim of an assault on hotel property should immediately contact Security.  Associates should never put themselves at risk.</p>

<p>If the injuries received in the assault are serious or life-threatening, immediately contact local emergency services (9-1-1 in the U.S.)  Do not move the victim, but stay with them until help arrives.  If the injuries received are relatively minor and immediate emergency medical help is not required, take the victim to a safe and secure spot – such as the Director of Security’s office – immediately contact local law enforcement and attempt to provide aid and comfort until police arrive and/or medical assistance is arranged.  In particular, extreme care should be taken with victims of sexual assault, who may be emotionally distraught.  In any event, always show concern and compassion toward the victim.</p>

<p>If the victim is female, have a female accompany the response team, whenever possible.  Determine as soon as possible if the alleged attacker is believed to be either a guest or associate of the hotel.  Provide all information and assistance to law enforcement. </p> 

<p>DO NOT comment to guests about an assault that occurs on the property or provide any details about the victim.  DO NOT refer to previous incidents that may have occurred at the hotel.  If asked specifically by guests about an incident, politely respond that it is being investigated by Security or local law enforcement and comment no further.</p>
