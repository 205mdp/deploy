<h2>E:2.5.2	HOMICIDE</h2>
 

<p>In the event of a homicide on Hotel property, all associates should keep several fundamental ideas in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not touch or allow anyone to disturb anything at the crime scene.</li>
	<li>Do not alarm guests.  Respond and react to reports of a homicide in a calm and controlled manner.</li>
	<li>Isolate area and clear of any guests or unneeded associates.</li>
	<li>Shield the victim and scene from view of guests.</li>


</ul>

<p>Any associate discovering an apparent homicide of a guest, visitor or fellow associate should immediately notify Security.  Stay in the immediate area until Security arrives on the scene to ensure that nothing is disturbed and to keep on-lookers away.</p>

<p>If unsure whether the victim is dead, contact an associate on duty who is CPR trained.</p>

<p>Though understandably difficult, it is important that all hotel staff keep a professional appearance and attitude so that guests do not panic if and when news of the homicide begins to spread.
</p>
<p>Arrange for the nearest available guest room for use by authorities as their command center as the investigation is likely to take quite some time.</p>	
<p>Rumors may quickly begin to spread among guests – even among associates.  If questioned by others who have heard rumors or witnessed some activity, associates should simply say there is a medical emergency or something similar.  Let them know that the matter is being handled, but more information is not available at the moment.  DO NOT speculate or offer any other comments.
</p>
<p>If associates are directly exposed to the action or scene, ensure associates are provided EAP services.</p>

<p>Media interest in a homicide is likely.  However, DO NOT attempt to respond to media inquiries.  Instead refer all inquiries to the General Manager. The General Manager should refer all media to the authorities.  Associates should be reminded that all media inquiries should be referred to the General Manager.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<ul>

	<ul>

		<li>If there are any witnesses</li>
		<li>If anyone in the area is acting suspicious</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Notify the Emergency Response Team.  Do not announce over the radio the nature of the situation.</li>
	<li>Respond to the scene.  ENSURE THAT NOTHING IS DISTURBED.</li>
	<li>Keep on-lookers away in a calm manner.</li>
	<li>Use back-of-the-house elevators if at all possible.</li>
	<li>If the homicide occurred in a public area of the property, determine if videotape of the crime exists.  If so, secure the videotape.</li>
	<li>See instructions for the Director of Security (below) and assist as needed.</li>
