<h2>E:2.5.3	ROBBERY</h2>
<p>In the event of a robbery or attempted robbery, all associates should cooperate with the robber to reduce the risk of assault or injuries.  As soon as possible – and without risk to associates or guests – notify Security.  If the hotel is equipped with “alarm buttons,” activate the alarm to alert the appropriate personnel only after the perpetrator has left.</p>

<p>AT NO TIME SHOULD ANY ASSOCIATE ATTEMPT TO APPROACH OR APPREHEND A ROBBERY SUSPECT.  That job is the responsibility of law enforcement.  Instead, cooperate with the robber, observe and take note of as much detail as possible (e.g. appearance and clothes), and then provide all information to the police.</p>

	<li>Note if the suspect touches anything.  After the suspect(s) leave, place a piece of paper over any area they touched to preserve fingerprint evidence.  PRESERVE THE CRIME SCENE.</li>
	<li>If a note is used in the robbery, attempt to keep it.  However, if the suspect demands its return, give it back.  Handle the note as little as possible.  DO NOT let anyone else touch it.   </li>
	<li>If given the opportunity, attempt to activate the “alarm button,” but DO NOT ENDANGER YOURSELF.</li>
	<li>If unable to active the alarm while the suspect(s) are in front of you, do so after they leave.</li>
