<h2>E:2.5.4	THEFT</h2>
<p>Theft is considered the undetected stealing of a guest’s items (for example, money, jewelry, luggage) from a guest’s room/car or the hotel’s public areas, as opposed to a physical robbery in which an assailant confronts a guest in a threatening manner to steal items.</p>

<p>If any guest, visitor or associate reports a theft, immediately contact Security.  Stay with the guest until Security arrives and always exhibit genuine concern about their loss.  DO NOT comment to the guest or visitor about any previous incidents that may have occurred on the property.</p>

<p>A victim of theft may be irate, stunned or even fearful upon discovering their loss.  They may blame the hotel and its security (or perceived lack thereof) for the theft of their items.  It is important, therefore, that all associates maintain a calm and professional demeanor when dealing with a victim of theft so that the guest is made to feel more secure and comfortable, and an unpleasant situation does not escalate further.</p>
