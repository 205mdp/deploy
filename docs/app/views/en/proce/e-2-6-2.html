<h2>E:2.6.2	DROWNING</h2>

<p>When a member of hotel staff discovers a guest or associate who has apparently drowned – in the hotel pool, at the hotel’s private beach, or even in the bathtub – the first response should be to immediately remove the person from the water.</p>

<p>Contact Hotel Security or call the emergency services number (9-1-1 in the U.S.). </p>
 
<p>Attempt at once to determine if the person has a pulse or is breathing.  If so, begin providing CPR, if certified.  If not certified in CPR, remain on the scene until help arrives.</p>

<p>If the person is obviously deceased, while awaiting Security attempt to keep on-lookers away from the scene.  DO NOT speculate or comment to any on-lookers about how or why the drowning may have occurred.</p>
