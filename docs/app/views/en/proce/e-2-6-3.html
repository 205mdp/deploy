<h2>E:2.6.3	NATURAL DEATH</h2>
<p>Natural death is defined as death that occurs without apparent reason, such as due to disease or injury or foul play.</p>
  
 <p>Hotel staff should react quickly and discreetly if they discover an associate, guest or visitor who has apparently passed away from natural causes.  Any person finding what they believe is a deceased person should immediately contact Security.  DO NOT attempt to move the body.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to alarm any guests.  If questioned by on-lookers who have witnessed activity surrounding the deceased, associates should merely say there is a medical emergency or something similar.  Offer no details and do not confirm there is a death.  If the person inquiring is aware of the death do not speculate as to the cause of death.</p>
