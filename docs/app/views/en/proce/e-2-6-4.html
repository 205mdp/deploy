<h2>E:2.6.4	DEATH/SUICIDE OR ATTEMPTED/ THREATENED SUICIDE</h2>

<p>Hotel staff should react quickly and discreetly in the event of a non-natural death or suicide of an associate, guest or visitor.  Any associate finding what they believe is a deceased person should immediately contact Security.  If there is any question as to whether the person is alive, contact associates on-shift with CPR or First Aid training.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to alarm any guests.  If questioned by on-lookers who have witnessed activity surrounding the deceased, associates should simply say there is a medical emergency.  Offer no details and do not confirm there is a death.  If the person inquiring is aware of the death do not speculate as to the cause of death.</p>

<p>Regarding attempted or threatened suicide, immediately contact Security.  Stay with the person in duress until expert help arrives, always showing compassion and concern in a calm manner.  Do not put yourself at risk when staying with the person.  Do not comment on the situation to other guests.</p>

<p>If associates are directly exposed to the action or scene, ensure associates are provided EAP services.</p>
