<h2>E:2.6.5	ELECTROCUTION</h2> 

<p>Electrocution can originate from several sources, including contact with overhead power lines, downed electrical wires, defective appliances or lightning.
</p>
<p>Victims of electric shock may exhibit the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Muscle spasms</li>
	<li>Seizures</li>	
	<li>Interrupted breathing</li>
	<li>Irregular heartbeats or cardiac arrest</li>
	<li>Third degree burns</li>
	<li>Unconsciousness</li>
</ul>

<p>The longer that a victim is in contact with an electrical current, the less likely are the chances of survival.</p>

<p>As a result, rescue operations or first aid must be initiated quickly.  However, it is extremely important that certain precautions are taken before attempting to rescue or offer aid to an electrocution victim; otherwise the rescuer himself may become electrocuted.</p>

<p>Contact with high-voltage electricity such as that carried by power lines is usually instantaneously fatal.  DO NOT attempt to remove a victim from a high voltage wire and stay at least 20 feet away since the electricity can arc through the air.  Instead, immediately contact local emergency services (9-1-1 in the U.S.).</p>

<p>Victims of less intense electric shocks, however, can recover if rescue operations and first aid are initiated quickly.  The steps below should be followed in attempting to aid a victim of electrocution:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NEVER touch a victim until the power is off.</li>
	<li>First, shut off the current at the fuse box or unplug the electrical equipment/appliance in use.  Simply turning off the equipment is inadequate.</li>
	<li>If it is not possible to shut off the power, stand on a dry insulated surface (for example, a rubber mat, a stack of newspapers, a board, or pile of clothes) and use a NON-METAL object such as wood or rubber to separate the victim from the wires.</li>
	<li>Take caution to avoid contact with anything damp or wet.  Make sure your hands and feet are dry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Victims of lightning strikes can be assisted immediately since the lightning current passes through the body and disappears.  Rescuers do not need to worry about sustaining a shock from the victim.</p>

<p>Once a victim has been separated from the source of the shock, immediately check for breathing and a pulse.  If the victim is not breathing â€“ and if trained in the technique -- begin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  If the victim has no pulse, begin CPR.  Cover the victim with a blanket.  In any event, get emergency medical attention as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If the victim has sustained burns due to electrical shock, cover the burns with dry, sterile dressing.  Do not cool the burns or apply grease or oil to them.</p>

<p>Throughout the rescue and first-aid process, guests and associates should be kept well away from the victim and the source of the electrical shock.</p>
 
<h3>DIRECTOR OF SECURITY</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If notified about an electrocution incident, immediately contact local emergency services (9-1-1 in the U.S.).  Give the location of the victim, as well as their condition if known, and the source of the electrical shock.</li>
	<li>Contact Engineering to shut off power to the affected area, if applicable.</li>
	<li>Cordon off the scene and do not allow anyone to enter the area or touch any objects.</li>


</ul>
<h3>ENGINEERING</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shut off power to the affected area, if applicable, and assist Security in keeping onlookers away from the scene.</li>
	<li>Contact a trained electrician, if appropriate, to inspect and repair any electrical components suspected of causing the electrocution.</li>
	<li>Inform Security and the General Manager when the area has been declared safe.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GENERAL MANAGER</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Follow up with the victim after a reasonable period to inquire about their well-being.</li>
	<li>If the victim does not survive the electrocution, confirm with local authorities that they will notify the next of kin.  (See below).</li>
	<li>Refer media inquires to law enforcement.</li>
	<li>Contact the Division Representative to the Corporate Crisis Response Team.</li>

</ul>
