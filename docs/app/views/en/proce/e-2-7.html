<h3>E:2.7 EARTHQUAKES/TSUNAMI</h3>
<p>In the event of an earthquake, the main tasks of the Hotel staff are to assist guests and associates, prevent panic, assess the damage and take measures to prevent further damage.</p>


<p>During an earthquake, remain calm. DO NOT EVACUATE the building unless directed to do so. Generally the safest place to be is inside the building underneath a table or desk, under a doorway or against a structural wall. It is important to stay away from windows, furniture or fixtures that may collapse. If an evacuation of the Hotel is ordered, follow the instructions under EVACUATION.</p>
<p>Be aware that earthquakes and aftershocks may trigger secondary events such as fire, tsunamis, landslides, liquefaction, flooding and the release and/or spread of hazardous materials.
</p>
<p>Earthquakes occasionally produce unusually large sea waves, called tsunamis.  Although not all earthquakes produce tsunamis, coastal Hotels are at the greatest risk within 24 hours of an earthquake. Coastal Hotels should be prepared to evacuate to higher ground in the event that a tsunami watch or warning has been announced. Follow instructions as directed by the Civil Defense or local authorities.
</p>
<p>Off-duty associates who call in to work should first ensure the safety of their families and then, depending on the severity of the earthquake, report to work. Associates should listen to news reports regarding the safety of travel on the streets.
