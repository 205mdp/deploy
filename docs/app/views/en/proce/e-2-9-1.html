        </a>
<h2>FIRE</h2>

<h3>UPON NOTICING A FIRE, AN ASSOCIATE SHOULD:</h3>
<p>The first associate to discover a fire must act quickly and calmly.  There are four action steps to take -- just remember “NEED.”</p>

<h3><strong>N Notify </strong>the Hotel Operator </h3> 
<ul>
	<li>Activate the nearest pull station if available.</li>
	<li>Call the hotel operator, the Hotels’ emergency number or Security; give specific details.</li>
	<li>Operator will call the fire department and notify the Emergency Response Team.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>E	Evacuate the immediate area!</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Isolate the fire -- close doors, windows, etc.</li>
	<li>If on guest floors, begin evacuating the affected floor first, followed by the floor above and the floor below.  Assist guests to the nearest stairwell.  Do not use elevators.  Instruct guests to go to the designated assembly area.</li>
	<li>Clear area of all carts and obstructions.</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>E	Extinguish fire if reasonably safe to do so.</strong> </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Only extinguish after the Operator has been notified and the above steps have been taken.</li>
	<li>Locate nearest fire extinguisher and follow the operating instructions on the extinguisher.</li>
	<li>Do not try to fight the fire if it is too big.  Extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher only if it is safe to do so and you have been trained.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIGHT FIRES ALONE.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EXTINGUISH FIRES THAT ARE LARGER THAN ‘WASTEPAPER BASKET’ SIZE.  (Be aware that larger fires can give off toxic fumes).</li>
	<li>If the fire is larger than a wastepaper basket size, isolate the fire by closing the door(s) to the area, and move to safety using the nearest fire exit. </li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>D	Direct the Emergency Response Team to the fire.</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Relay all information to the Emergency Response Team.</li>
	<li>Assist as directed by the Emergency Response Team.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to assist in evacuation or to evacuate yourself.</li>
</ul>	

<H3>UPON SMELLING SMOKE, AN ASSOCIATE SHOULD:</H3>
<ul>
	<li>Call the Hotel’s emergency number and/or operator and give specific details (for example, room, floor, location). </li>
	<li>Be prepared to activate the nearest fire alarm.</li>
	<li>Find the nearest fire stairwell.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to assist evacuating guests and associates if necessary.</li>

</ul>

<h4>IF A FIRE DETECTION DEVICE IS ACTIVATED OR SMOKE IS REPORTED, BUT THERE IS NO CONFIRMATION OF FIRE:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Security should immediately notify the Emergency Response Team via two-way radio.  Give location and type of device activated.</li>
	<li>(Sample announcement:  Code-1, Ballroom, Fire Alarm)</li>
	<li>All members of the Emergency Response Team should acknowledge the radio transmission.</li>
	<li>Appropriate Emergency Response Team members should respond to the location of the alarm and physically check the area for smoke or other cause of alarm.</li>
	<li>All other members of the ERT should respond to the Command Center.</li>
	<li>Engineering should bring appropriate tools (fire extinguisher, bolt cutters, flashlight, etc.).</li>
	<li>If utilizing elevators to respond to the alarm, stop two floors below the fire floor and walk to the fire floor.  (Note, some systems prevent elevator use when alarm sounds.)</li>
	<li>Upon arrival at the alarmed floor, notify the Emergency Response Team by radio. </li>
	<li>Once at the door to the alarmed floor, feel the door handle or frame to see if it is hot.  If it is hot or smoke is visible, DO NOT OPEN.  Contact local emergency services (9-1-1 in the U.S.) and wait for the fire department to arrive.  The General Manager should begin evacuation procedures.</li>
	<li>If it is not hot, open the door and proceed to the location of the alarm.</li>
	<li>General Manager should request that an announcement be made over the public address system or available communication process for floors affected by the alarm.  (Sample announcement:  Ladies and gentlemen, a fire alarm has been activated on your floor.  We are currently investigating the cause of the alarm and will keep you informed.)</li>
	<li>Begin searching for evidence of fire, smoke, and the activated alarm device.</li>
	<li>If it is determined that the activated alarm was not caused by smoke or fire, await arrival of the Fire Department and their authorization to reset the fire alarm system.</li>
	<li>General Manager should request that appropriate announcements be made over the public address system or available communication process.</li>
	
</ul>

<h4>IF THERE IS A CONFIRMED FIRE (REPORTED BY AN ASSOCIATE OR GUEST), OR FIRE IS OBSERVED WHEN RESPONDING TO AN ALARM: 
OPERATOR</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Immediately contact Security giving all known details.</li>
	<li>Contact Guest Reception and obtain a list of all occupied rooms.  List should highlight all rooms containing disabled, elderly or very young guests.  Have Guest Reception give a copy of the list to the Emergency Response Team at the Fire Command Post once established. </li>
	<li>If given the order to evacuate by the General Manager or Security, start calling occupied rooms to inform guests to evacuate.  The order of the calls should be:  fire floor; one floor above; one floor below; all remaining floors starting with floors above the fire.  INSTRUCT EVACUEES TO USE FIRE STAIRWELLS, NOT ELEVATORS.</li>
