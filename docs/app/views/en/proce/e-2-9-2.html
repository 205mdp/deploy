<h2>EXPLOSION</h2>

<p>Explosions are generally handled in a manner similar to that of responding to a fire.  In fact, if a fire erupts as a result of an explosion, procedures in the sections beginning with ‘IF THERE IS A CONFIRMED FIRE…’ should be followed for handling the immediate fire emergency.</p>

<p>When responding to explosions, extreme caution should be taken in case the initial blast triggers subsequent explosions.  In addition, if gas is smelled at any time, immediately leave the area and begin an evacuation of the hotel.  DO NOT LIGHT ANY FLAME or activate other initiators such as turning on lights..</p>
