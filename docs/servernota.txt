.htaccess 
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, x-requested-with, content-type"
Header add Access-Control-Allow-Methods "PUT, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS"

By default Apache has .htaccess disabled, so you would have to enable it.

Got to and edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

You will find a section that looks like this:

<Directory />
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
</Directory>
You have to change AllowOverride None to AllowOverride All and then find the section right after which should start with: <Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents"> and you'll have to change the same thing there to AllowOverride All
